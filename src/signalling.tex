\section{You have a sensor positioned a meter away from a central controller, what type of signal would you use to transfer the data?}
The sensor is a temperature sensor and readings are needed at a rate of 100 Hz with a precision of 0.1C and a temperature range of -40C to 125C.

\noindent I2C or UART protocol should be selected in this case. 

\subsection{Digital Signalling}

% Logic Level & Shifting

% Differential vs. Single ended
% Busses vs point to point protocols
% Full-Duplex vs Half-Duplex
% Push Pull vs Open Drain 

The most common digital protocols in embedded systems are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PWM (\textit{Pulse Width Modulation})
    \item UART (\textit{Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter}) is a single-ended serial
    \item I2C
    \item SPI
    \item CAN
    \item Ethernet
    \item USB
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analog Signalling}
% differential vs single ended analog signals, maybe some thermistor circuits
