\subsection{Digital Signalling}

% Logic Level & Shifting

% Differential vs. Single ended
% Busses vs point to point protocols
% Full-Duplex vs Half-Duplex
% Push Pull vs Open Drain 

The most common digital protocols in embedded systems are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item PWM (\textit{Pulse Width Modulation})
    \item UART (\textit{Universal Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter}) is a single-ended serial
    \item I2C
    \item SPI
    \item CAN
    \item Ethernet
    \item USB
\end{itemize}
