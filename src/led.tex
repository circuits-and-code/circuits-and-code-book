How to power a green LED at 10mA current from an MCU with a 5V drive capability? The MCU can source/sink 5mA. 
Series resistor and LED
Important parameters to consider when selecting the LED and the resistor: Maths, forward drop, ideal source voltage, edge cases

\subsection{Pulse Width Modulation}
How would you control the brightness of the LED?
