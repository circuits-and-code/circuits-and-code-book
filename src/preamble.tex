\section{Introduction}

This guide was created by two Waterloo Engineering students, \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpuratich}{Daniel Puratich} (EE '26) and \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-kale}{Sahil Kale} (Tron '25). Passionate about mentoring and supporting our peers in their co-op journeys, we realized we were frequently addressing the same questions. Noticing that many firmware and hardware co-op interviews focus on fundamental concepts, we decided to compile a comprehensive list of commonly asked questions and answers to help students better prepare for their interviews.

\subsection{About the Authors}
Sahil interned at Tesla, Skydio, and BETA Technologies, focusing on real-time embedded software for safety-critical control systems. Connect with Sahil on LinkedIn: \textcolor{blue}{\underline{\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-kale}{Sahil Kale}}}.

Daniel interned at Tesla, Anduril Industries, and Pure Watercraft, focusing on electrical engineering and PC board design. Connect with Daniel on LinkedIn: \textcolor{blue}{\underline{\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpuratich}{Daniel Puratich}}}.

\subsection{Target Audience}
Our guide is designed for engineering undergraduates seeking technical internships in embedded software, firmware, and electrical engineering across the US and Canada. The questions and answers aim to provide a foundational understanding, making them ideal for those just starting in the field.
\newline
\newline
\noindent We both study at the University of Waterloo, where all engineering students complete six co-op/internship terms as part of their undergraduate program. This provides students with invaluable work experience before graduation and the chance to explore different types of roles within their field.
