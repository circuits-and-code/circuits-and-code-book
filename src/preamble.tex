\section{Introduction}

This guide was created by two Waterloo Engineering students, \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpuratich}{Daniel Puratich} (EE '26) and \href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/sahil-kale}{Sahil Kale} (Tron '25). Wanting to support our peers in their co-op journeys, we noticed that we were often answering the same questions when asked about co-op interview prep. Noticing that many firmware and hardware co-op interviews focus on fundamental concepts, we decided to compile a comprehensive list of commonly asked questions and answers to help students better prepare for their interviews.

\subsection{About the Authors}

Daniel interned at Tesla, Anduril Industries, and Pure Watercraft, focusing on electrical engineering and PC board design. Connect with Daniel on LinkedIn: \textcolor{blue}{\underline{\href{https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpuratich}{Daniel Puratich}}}.

\subsection{Target Audience}
Our guide is designed for engineering undergraduates seeking technical internships in embedded software, firmware, and electrical engineering across the US and Canada. The questions and answers aim to provide a foundational understanding, making them ideal for those just starting in the field.

\subsection{How to Use This Guide}
This guide is structured to help you understand and answer common technical questions asked in firmware and hardware co-op interviews. Each section starts by introducing a question and relevant informational content, followed by a detailed answer. We recommend reading through the content and attempting to answer the questions yourself before reviewing the provided answers.
\newline
\newnoindentpara Embedded systems cover a broad range of topics that intersect hardware and software. While most questions in this guide are broadly applicable to both firmware and hardware roles, some are tailored to specific industries. For example, topics like mutexes versus semaphores are more likely to appear in firmware interviews, whereas hardware-oriented questions might focus on circuit design or component selection. We recommend focusing on the questions most relevant to your target role while gaining a general understanding of both fields.

\subsubsection{Code}
Code snippets are included to illustrate various embedded software concepts. The code is written in C and can be copied and compiled/run at your discretion, though some snippets may require the inclusion of additional header files and minor restructuring.
