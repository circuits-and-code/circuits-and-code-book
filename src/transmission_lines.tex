%How would you measure the length of a 50 ohm coaxial cable ? 
% Maybe make this a follow-up question
% If you probe the resistance of a 50 ohm coaxial cable on one end with the other end open circuit with a DMM, what resistance does it show? 
% What if the cable is infinitely long?

\section{How would you determine the length of an unknown coaxial cable?} \label{section:Transmission_lines}

You cannot using a mechanical measurement device (i.e. measuring tape, ruler, etc.).

\subsection{Transmission Lines}

% TODO

\subsection{Characteristic Impedance}

Characteristic impedance relates voltage and current waves 

% TODO : Add link to the Alpha Phoenix videos, I love those for explain char impedance and velocity factor
% should look through the WARG EE bookshelf stuff

% how trace width and stackup affect char impedance, what vias do to it as well! 

% TODO

\subsection{Scattering Parameters}

% TODO
% Scattering Parameters are used to describe power flow in high frequency circuits. 
% While Scattering Parameters are useful for analysis of losses and transmissions, other parametric systems are used as well to aid in different forms of analysis\footnote{See Impedance, Admittance, & ABCD matrixes}

% Define return loss and insertion loss?

% 20log vs 10log could in incorporated as well 



\subsection{Propagation Constant}

% TODO

\subsection{Smith Chart}

% TODO : Explain why this exists basically, dont do anything crazy with it 

\subsection{Follow-ups}
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is impedance matching? Where is it used and why? 
    % \item Is measuring S11 a valid method of comparing the effectiveness of an antenna? % Looking for discussions of radiated power versus lost power. ie Lossy antennas such as the monopole with essentially a lowest possible loss-less S11. Also radiation pattern might be nice to discuss the importance of. The section doesn't really discuss antennas so removing for now? 
    \item Can an RF transmitter be damaged if it transmits when it's antenna is disconnected? Why? % Yes, Power reflects back and fries the power amplifier due to large S11. This is an important concept
