\subsection{Passives}
% This section introducing passives is very long, but it's critical information. Worst case we can move it to the extra practice question I guess, but I'd rather optimize this question's length in other methods. 
\noindent For a question like this, assuming ideal components is expected as further information has not been provided to aid in a more complex analysis. In a real interview, it's likely you would be given just one of these circuits. Table \ref{tab:passive_definitions} provides a summary of the key properties of ideal resistors, capacitors, and inductors.
% Numerous circuits are analyzed for the sake of building intuition and the showing first principles approach.

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        & Resistor & Capacitor & Inductor \\ \hline
        Time Domain & $V = I \cdot R$ & $I = C \cdot \dfrac{dv}{dt}$ & $V = L \cdot \dfrac{di}{dt}$ \\ \hline
        Frequency Domain & $Z = R$ & $Z = \dfrac{1}{j \cdot \omega \cdot C}$ & $Z = j \cdot \omega \cdot L$ \\ \hline
        As $f \to \infty$ & $Z = R$ & $Z \to 0$ & $Z \to \infty$ \\ \hline
        As $f \to 0$ & $Z = R$ & $Z \to \infty$ & $Z \to 0$ \\ \hline
        Energy Stored & $E = 0$ & $E = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot C \cdot V^{2}$ & $E = \dfrac{1}{2} \cdot L \cdot I^{2}$ \\ \hline
        Real Power Dissipation & $P = I \cdot V$ & $P = 0$ & $P = 0$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Passive Element Definitions}
    \label{tab:passive_definitions}
\end{table}

\noindent Keep in mind when interpreting table \ref{tab:passive_definitions} that:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The relationship between angular frequency and frequency is given by: $\omega = 2 \pi f$.
    \item Impedance, $Z$, is frequency dependent for circuits with inductors and capacitors.
    \item $Z = \dfrac{V}{I}$ represents the impedance of a circuit. 
    \item The imaginary component of impedance, $Z$, represents reactance $X$ which defines a phase shift between $V$ and $I$.
    \item Resistors have no frequency dependence and do not store any energy though they do dissipate power, $P = I \cdot V = I^{2} \cdot R = \dfrac{V^2}{R}$.
    \item An open circuit (nets that are completely isolated from each other) is represented as connected by an impedance of value $Z = \infty$.
    \item A short circuit (nets that are at the same voltage potential) is represented as connected by an impedance of value $Z = 0$. 
    \item For a series connection of impedances $Z_1$, $Z_2$, \dots, $Z_n$, the equivalent impedance is given by $Z = Z_1 + Z_2 + \cdots + Z_n$.
    \item For a parallel connection of impedances $Z_1$, $Z_2$, \dots, $Z_n$, the equivalent impedance is calculated as $\dfrac{1}{Z} = \dfrac{1}{Z_1} + \dfrac{1}{Z_2} + \cdots + \dfrac{1}{Z_n}$.
    \item For two impedances in parallel, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, the formula $\dfrac{1}{Z} = \dfrac{1}{Z_1} + \dfrac{1}{Z_2}$ can be simplified algebraically to $Z = \dfrac{Z_1 \cdot Z_2}{Z_1 + Z_2}$. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Step Response}
The step response of a circuit is what the output waveform with respect to time looks like given a unit step is applied to the input. Traditionally, this means plotting $V_{out}$ waveform given 

\[ V_{in}(t) = \begin{cases} 0 & t < 0 \\ 1 & t \geq 0 \end{cases} \]

% Frequency domain connection probably isn't needed here? 
% \noindent In the Laplace domain, the unit step function is given by $V_{in}(j \omega) = \dfrac{1}{j \omega}$. To determine the response of a circuit in the Laplace domain, $V_{out}(j \omega) = V_{in}{j \omega} * H(j \omega)$ where $H(j \omega)$ defines the system transfer function. 
% consider adding a plot in the frequency domain showing the step response and explain implications to above passives

\subsection{Circuit A: Series Resistor}
In this circuit we note Ohm's law, $V = I \cdot R$, however, as there is no load, $I=0$ on the resistor in this circuit we note there is no voltage drop, $V=I \cdot R=0 \cdot R=0$, across the resistor, consequently $V_{in} = V_{out}$ for this circuit. \newline
% No need to actual draw a plot of Vin = Vout as readers should be able to follow this themselves and the plot wouldn't really show it nicely anyways.

\newnoindentpara Note for this circuit, and for all subsequent circuits as well, an assumption is made that there is no extra loading on $V_{out}$ and there is no source impedance on $V_{in}$. This is reasonable as the question shows no extra loading drawn and the question does not state otherwise.

\subsection{Circuit B: Voltage Divider}
This circuit is a voltage divider depicted slightly differently than in a previous question\footnote{Question: \ref{sec:voltage_divider}}, but the same equations hold: $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \dfrac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}$. In this case, to produce a step response plot an assumption is required about the values of $R_1$ and $R_2$. For simplicity, it is assumed that $R_1 = R_2$, resulting in the following transfer function: $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = 1/2$.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{generated_images/voltage_divider.png}
    \caption{Step Response of a Voltage Divider Circuit}
    \label{fig:step-response-voltage-divider}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Circuit C: RC Low Pass Filter}
Circuits with inductors and capacitors are dependent on time and frequency and can be analyzed in either domain. For the circuit in Figure \ref{fig:rc_low_pass_filter} analysis will be performed in the time domain. \newline
% Philosophy: the subsequent question uses frequency domain. extra practice questions allow readers to explore to their hearts desire either approach. 

% Solving this circuit fully in time domain because it is conceptually simple even though mathematically complex.
\newnoindentpara Analyzing the two elements in the circuit in time domain shows $I = C \cdot \dfrac{dV_{out}}{dt}$ and $V_{in} - V_{out} = I \cdot R$. As $I$ is equivalent in both elements, it can be cancelled out when solving the system of equations, resulting in $V_{in} - V_{out} = R \cdot C \cdot \dfrac{dV_{out}}{dt}$. This expression can be algebraically manipulated into $-\dfrac{dV_{out}}{V_{out}-V_{in}} = -\dfrac{dt}{R \cdot C}$. Integrating both sides, the expression becomes $\ln{\dfrac{V_{out}-V_{in}}{V_{out}}}=-\dfrac{t}{R \cdot C}$. \newline 

\newnoindentpara After re-arranging the above expression, the solution to the differential equation is given by equation \ref{eq:lpf-ode}.
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = 1-e^{\left( \dfrac{-t}{R \cdot C} \right)}
    \label{eq:lpf-ode}
\end{equation}

\noindent Note when analyzing this circuit, a constant $\tau = R \cdot C$ is defined as the time constant of the RC circuit which represents the time it takes $1-e^{-1}$ or ~63 percent of the step size. As the question allows assumptions to be made for component values, a logical assumption is to select $R$ and $C$ that $\tau = R \cdot C = 1$ for simplicity as the transfer function becomes $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = 1-e^{-t}$.

    \label{fig:step-response-low-pass-filter}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Connection to I2C}
The low-pass filter circuit is extremely fundamental and shows up in a variety of situations. Consider an I2C digital signal in which all drivers are not asserting the line low - in this case, the signal trace has some parasitic capacitance to ground and a pull-up resistor is responsible for pulling the line to a logic high state. This can be modelled as an RC low-pass filter circuit - consequently, an I2C signal (such as the one shown in Figure \ref{fig:i2c_scl}, SCL line) will have a similar step response to the low-pass filter circuit.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{generated_images/i2c.png}
    \caption{I2C SCL Rise/Fall}
    \label{fig:i2c_scl}
\end{figure}

\noindent Increasing the value of $R_{pullup}$ results in less power consumption, but slower rise times as $\tau = R \cdot C$. There is often a lower limit to the value of $R_{pullup}$ as drivers must be rated for the current to pull the line low. Selecting the value of $R_{pullup}$ is a careful consideration for design engineers with values commonly ranging from $1 \text{k} \Omega$ to $10 \text{k} \Omega$.
% This is a really strong paragraph. I really want people to understand these tradeoffs!

    \label{fig:i2c_comparison}
\end{figure}


\noindent When tackling a question like this, performing a conceptual sanity check can be invaluable! Since a capacitor acts as an open circuit under DC conditions, it follows logically that as time approaches infinity, Circuit C will resemble Circuit A. 

\subsection{Circuit D: RC High Pass Filter}
For this question, a complex impedance approach will be used rather than time domain analysis (though both will produce the correct solution). The transfer function of a voltage divider, $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \dfrac{R_b}{R_t + R_b}$, can be applied to impedance values, resulting in $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \dfrac{Z_b}{Z_t + Z_b}$. For this circuit $Z_b = Z_r = R$ and $Z_t = Z_c = \dfrac{1}{j \cdot \omega \cdot C}$ can be substituted in to get $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \dfrac{R}{\dfrac{1}{j \cdot \omega \cdot C} + R}$. \newline

\newnoindentpara When in the time domain $t \approx \infty$ in the frequency $\omega \approx 0$, this the transfer function becomes $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \dfrac{R}{\dfrac{1}{j \cdot 0 \cdot C} + R} = \dfrac{R}{\infty + R} = \dfrac{1}{\infty} = 0$. Additionally, at $t = 0$, the frequency domain representation of the edge contains very high frequencies where $\omega \approx \infty$, so the transfer function becomes $\dfrac{V_{out}}{V_{in}} = \dfrac{R}{\dfrac{1}{j \cdot \infty \cdot C} + R} = \dfrac{R}{0 + R} = 1$. \newline
\newline

\newnoindentpara Interpreting these results, we see that this circuit exhibits no gain at low or zero frequency and a gain of 1 at high frequencies. Consequently, it allows high-frequency signals to pass, which is why it is called a \textit{high-pass filter}. A step input contains a wide range of frequency components, including high frequencies, which the filter initially allows to pass. This results in a sharp initial response, which then tapers off over time as lower-frequency components dominate. This matches the behavior observed in Figure \ref{fig:step-response-high-pass-filter}.

\subsection{Follow-ups}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Given an unknown discrete capacitor find the capacitance? How would you determine the capacitance at a given DC bias voltage? % First part is Circuit C. Second part a solution is use Circuit E with an initial condition on Vout as the bias and a very small Iin current.
    \item For circuit C, does changing the value of R (assuming all else remains constant) change the total energy dissipated in the resistor? % Answer is no and requires an interesting integral to prove. Someone asked me this recently and I thought it was fun bc i had to do the proof live in fronta them lool. 
    \item Consider the circuits given in extra practice question \ref{extra_practice:more_passives}. % More complex circuits for consideration
