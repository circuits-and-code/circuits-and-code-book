\section{How would you sense how much current is flowing through a PCB to a load?}

\subsection{Motivation}
Embedded systems often need to track power and current consumption of loads to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Determine battery state of charge by integrating the power the battery has been charged and discharged over time
    \item Detect failures if a load is drawing an excessive amount of power. 
    \item Ensure the system does not provide too much power to
\end{itemize}
Power and current are electrically related by $P = I * V$. We've already seen how sense microcontroller's can sense voltages, $V$, so now we need to sense current to determine power.
