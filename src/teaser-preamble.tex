\section{Book Introduction}
Circuits and Code offers over 20 interview-style questions and answers designed for embedded software and electrical engineering interns. Written by two authors with experience hiring and mentoring interns for embedded software and electrical engineering roles, it draws on their academic background and industry expertise to focus on the concepts that matter most to interviewers. \newline

\newnoindentpara With clear, concise explanations, coding snippets, and sample circuit diagrams, this guide provides a practical resource for motivated students preparing for co-op interviews. The complete, thoughtfully designed questions are ideal for interview practice, helping you build confidence in areas like firmware development, control systems, and hardware design. Whether youâ€™re tackling your first technical interview or refining your skills, this book offers you the tools to succeed.

\newnoindentpara We met at (and both led) the Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group (WARG), a student team that designs and builds autonomous drones. Uniquely, we have experience in hiring and interviewing multiple co-op students, giving us insight into the interview process from both sides, as well as an understanding of what responses are expected from candidates. We value mentorship, enjoy sharing our knowledge, and take pride in helping others succeed in their co-op journeys.
